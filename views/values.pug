          | Values are the large scale criteria we use to judge what we see, think, and do. Making values explicit is important because without values, practices quickly become repetitive, activities performed for their own sake but lacking any purpose or direction. So when you are following HDD, simply keep these values in mind. Consider them as a guidance mechanism in all the practices you do as part of HDD.
