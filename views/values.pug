          | Values are the large scale criteria we use to judge what we see, think, and do. Making values explicit is important because without values, practices quickly become repetitive, activities performed for their own sake but lacking any purpose or direction. So when you are following HDD, simply keep these values in mind. Consider them as a guidance mechanism in all the practices you do as part of HDD.

        h2 Developer Experience
        p  Developer Experience is a term with a self-declaring meaning — the experience of developers — but it eludes definition in the sense that people invoke it at different times for different reasons referring to different things.

        p  Majestic Monolith is an integrated system that collapses as many unnecessary conceptual models as possible. Eliminates as much needless abstraction as you can swing a hammer at. It’s a big fat no to distributing your system lest it truly prevents you from doing what really needs to be done.

        h2 Single source of State
        p  Try to keep your application state in one place, like on the server, to avoid state synchronization issues and keep your view layers light and fast. Your view layer should only manipulate the state it requires to render the  view, not anything else. You should avoid storing large amounts of application data in the browser or the client side.

        p  Almost every website or web-application uses routing. Discovering a website by changing its URL is a very powerful feature that comes standard with the web. How all of this is handled can vary a lot between different websites and web-applications.
