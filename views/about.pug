      |  It is a development methodology heavily inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme Programming</a> by Kent Beck. It is an answer to the question, "what if we apply Extreme programming principles for today's web development practices" to tackle the complexity at the heart. What it will look like if we create a framework by forming a core set of values, principles and practices for Web Development based on XP.

      | It all started with this <a href="https://dev.to/rajasegar/htmx-and-html-driven-development-3800">blog post</a> on <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> where we have introduced the term HTML Driven Development. The Web development world is complex and chaotic today. We hope that if we adopt HDD as our development methodology, we can cut through the complexity surrounding today's web development practices, and instead focus on delivering quality, performant and sustainable solutions in the web to our customers and users.
